i have everything working for sync from obsidian: except possible webhook for my blog folder.

ill start looking at that right now

Fuck me I was able to sync 2 folders manage with remote git repos...im not sure I am supposed to be able to do this, but im double checking that these make it:

Obsidian > gitea > github mirror

fuck i had to start all over.  lets see if this syncs. i ll add another note too
