## Testing, testing
# Here I am looking to add posts direct from my gitea repo
1. This is the first one
2. The future looks to all posts being done in this fashion > I have gitea private repo with a mirror
   that keeps everything backed up in case the server goes down.
3. Testing the *.md > I will also duplicate the about tab for this wp so its saved for posterity.

~Thanks for looking at my blog!
