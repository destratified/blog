so I needed to do this for work, the idea being that I had to have access to a win10+ program on my laptop for work that has Linux arch.

I don't own windows so the gist is this:
1. install virtual box for arch
2. download and install win10+
3. debloat windows
4. enable rdp on win, setup new user and make sure rdp settings are ready
5. install and connect tailscale in win
6. install remmina and freerdp
7. turn on tailscale in laptop and connect to tailscale of rdp for win
