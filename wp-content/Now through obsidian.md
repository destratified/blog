So here's how everything is setup so far
1.  Obsidian on laptop, initially with folder obsidian_notes synced to local gitea
2.  Gitea repo of the same, mirrored to prived github repo
3.  Added the blog repo to gitea > private repo
4.  Setup mirror to my github repo of the same name > public
5.  Added Git it Write plugin to word press 
6.  Pulled gitea repo to local folder
7.  Added new local folder synce to gitea to obsidian
8.  Writing this note now.  Once I sync it should sync to gitea > github > wordpress
9.  So due to limitations I have cannot sync via obsidian directly as it won't manage 2 git folders
  a) however, i have a git push that syncs all my gitea folders if I am on my laptop. If I am editing from the web via gitea, or github it should work
  b) ill manage this with git pull/push for now

10.  Update: I have both my obsidian notes and my blog syncing automagically!!! Everything I was reading online seemed to indicate that I wasn't supposed to be able to do this
